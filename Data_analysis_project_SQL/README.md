# Nurse Workload Analysis (SQL Mini Project)

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
This mini-project explores nurse workload patterns across hospital departments using SQL.  
It is part of a series of healthcare data analysis projects designed to strengthen foundational SQL skills.

The simulated dataset contains three tables:
- **nurses** â€“ contains nurse information such as department, shift type, and gender.
- **patients** â€“ includes details of patient admissions, discharge, and ward.
- **assignments** â€“ links nurses to patients, showing hours spent and workload distribution.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives
- Reinforce understanding of basic SQL commands and clauses:
  - `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE` (with `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `BETWEEN`)
  - `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY`, `DISTINCT`, `LIMIT`
  - Aggregate functions: `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`
  - `DATEDIFF()` and aliasing with `AS`

- Practice real-world healthcare data queries and reporting.
