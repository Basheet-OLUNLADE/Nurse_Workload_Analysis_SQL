# Reflections on Nurse Workload Analysis SQL Project

1. Reinforced my understanding of SQL clauses and aggregate functions.
2. Practiced using WHERE with AND, OR, NOT, and BETWEEN conditions.
3. Learned how to use GROUP BY with HAVING to filter grouped results.
4. Understood how to calculate averages using DATEDIFF().
5. Improved confidence in joining multiple tables for analysis.
6. Next step: move on to JOINs and subqueries for deeper analysis.
